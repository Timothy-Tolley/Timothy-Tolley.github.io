          <h3>Learnings about Emotional Intelligence and Mindfulness</h3>
          <p>
            From the first chapter of I learnt the meaning of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the understanding the emotional state of yourself and those around you and using this understanding to shape thoughts and actions. This helped to bring clarification to the usefulness of mindfullness practice as it showed the correlation between understanding ones own emotions the time taken to connect with ourselves during mindfullness practice. The correlation between high emotional intelligence and success in work environments did not surprise me after understanding its meaning, however, it was interesting to recognise it in terms of the tech world. Mindfulness for myself was an interesting experience as I often only stop to relax once in bed. It took some concentration to focus on only my breathing but it did leave me feeling more relaxed than before.
