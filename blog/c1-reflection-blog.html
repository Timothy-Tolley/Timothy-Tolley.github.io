        <p>
           I am really excited to engage in a new form of learning from what I have formally been taught in previously.
           EDA/DBC seem to promote a form of learning that is much more practical and useful generally.
           I learn by 'doing' as well as engaging with others in a workspace so I am interested to start learning while working on challenges, especially within a team.
           The model of peers as resources and companions rather than competitors is a model which excites me.
           The encouragement of engaging with others work and the working together is exactly the sort of environment in which I have found myself  learning best in the past.
           The only worry I have in going into the bootcamp is that I know I get frustrated if I feel that I am being left behind and that this environment will make it very clear that I am struggling with a particular aspect.
           Although it seems like coding is a craft within which people find different niches so I hope this will make things less frustrating.
           Apart from that I am excited to engage in a practical learning enviornment which encourages sharing of the learning process.
           My expectations haven't changed from watching the fireside talk but rather they have been further clarified.
