    <h1>Reflection on <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's fireside chat </a></h1>

    <p>
       I am really excited to engage in a new form of learning from what I have formally been taught in previously.
       EDA/DBC seem to promote a form of learning that is much more practical and useful generally.
       I learn by 'doing' as well as engaging with others in a workspace so I am interested to start learning while working on challenges, especially within a team.
       The model of peers as resources and companions rather than competitors is a model which excites me.
       The encouragement of engaging with others work and the working together is exactly the sort of environment in which I have found myself  learning best in the past.
       The only worry I have in going into the bootcamp is that I know I get frustrated if I feel that I am being left behind and that this environment will make it very clear that I am struggling with a particular aspect.
       Although it seems like coding is a craft within which people find different niches so I hope this will make things less frustrating.
       Apart from that I am excited to engage in a practical learning enviornment which encourages sharing of the learning process.
       My expectations haven't changed from watching the fireside talk but rather they have been further clarified.
