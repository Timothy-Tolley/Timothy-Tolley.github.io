    <h1>Reflection on Time and Habits articles/videos</h1>

    <p>
       I am interested in pursuing tiny habits most of all out of the suggested reading. I find that I often want to intiate a habit but struggle commit to it fully. Tiny habits seems like an interesting method to cement a habit before pursuing it fully. I will try timeboxing on my next few assignments as I can see potential it has in improving productivity and will also help to set aside time for me to study. So far I have tried tiny habits in one instances - by doing two minutes of running at the end of my gym workouts. So far it has been successful and I will try to continue and increase the running time until I am able to do a proper warmdown after each gym session. I am interested in trying the pomodoro technique properly after hearing about it a lot during school but never having tried it in practice. Meditation is less appealing to me but I will try it over the next week or so in 2 minute sections as suggested in the "power of meditation" article and see if I see any changes. I also found the flow article very interesting in particular the section on hyperfocus. I look forward to trying some new methods to improve my productivity.
