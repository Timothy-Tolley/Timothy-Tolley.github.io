          <p>
            I am interested in pursuing tiny habits most of all out of the suggested reading.
            I find that I often want to intiate a habit but struggle commit to it fully. Tiny habits seems like an interesting method to cement a habit before pursuing it fully.
            I will try timeboxing on my next few assignments as I can see potential it has in improving productivity and will also help to set aside time for me to study.
            So far I have tried tiny habits in one instances - by doing two minutes of running at the end of my gym workouts.
            So far it has been successful and I will try to continue and increase the running time until I am able to do a proper warmdown after each gym session.
            I am interested in trying the pomodoro technique properly after hearing about it a lot during school but never having tried it in practice.
            Meditation is less appealing to me but I will try it over the next week or so in 2 minute sections as suggested in the "power of meditation" article and see if I see any changes.
            I also found the flow article very interesting in particular the section on hyperfocus.
            I look forward to trying some new methods to improve my productivity.
