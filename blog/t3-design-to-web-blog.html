        <h3> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important? </h3>

        <p>
          A repsonsive Website is one which is able to react and redesign itself in order to fit and function properly within different displays and screen sizes. It is hugely important to have a responsive website as in today's world it is extremely uncommon for a website to be accessed solely on one format. Thus using media queries the web designer tells the device how to display the website's content in a way which is optimised for its specific size.
        </p>

        <h3> What mobile-first design is, and why it's important?</h3>

        <P>
          Mobile-first design is a method of web design which focuses intially on optimising the mobile display of a website with media queries fulfilling the optimal responsive structures for larger devices. This is important as it allows devices with smaller screens - those which usually also have less processing power - to display a website by running minimal code. The larger devices filter through this early content which does not apply and reaches the more detailed code for its screen size/device. This helps the websites run smoothly no matter the device.
        </P>

        <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?</h3>

        <p>
          Frameworks are series of pre-made CSS, HTML and JS code which help in various ways including responsiveness. Skeleton is one such framework which is used from creating responsive websites. These frameworks can be great, they take away the need for lots of extra coding (by providing a simple structure) which can then help the user to create websites which are responsive or simply well structured. They can, however, be restrictive. It can difficult to get used to using another person's code, especially their class coding. It can also be difficult to develop a website exactly how you want to when you dont understand what code may be effecting what you're working on, deep inside the framework.

        </p>

        <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h3>

        <p>
          A wireframe is a simple design of a website which the designer is looking to create. It is made up of a series of boxes and minimal text which help to show the developer which structural elements need to be created within the webpage. We use these to help create the structure of the website before adding content.
        </p>

        <h3>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?</h3>
        <p>
          I found it difficult to impletment my featured blog post as it was difficult to understand that each container would automatically be divided into twelve columns rather than the six that it may represent within its row. I also struggled to create buttons with sat comfortably within the wireframe. I did add to the wireframe some category tags which were hard to create in a size which felt comfortable within the structure. Buttons styled in the skeleton framework were difficult to alter. I ran out of time to make my drop down menu on the blog post pages so have moved on for now.
